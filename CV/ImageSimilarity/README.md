### Image Similarity
The image similarity module calculates the similarity between given two images. It gives the similarity score between two images. It is based on CNN (convolutional Neural Networks) to extract the feature and then cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between the images.

### Model Details
In this module Resnet-50 has been used as feature extractor, which extracts the feature from both the given input images to be comapred and based on these features similarity scores are calulated using Cosine Similarity.
Resnet-50 is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model.

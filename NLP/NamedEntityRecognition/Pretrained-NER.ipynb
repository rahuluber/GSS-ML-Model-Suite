    "#### bert-base-NER\n",
    "<br>bert-base-NER is a fine-tuned BERT model that is ready to use for Named Entity Recognition and achieves state-of-the-art performance for the NER task. It has been trained to recognize four types of entities: location (LOC), organizations (ORG), person (PER) and Miscellaneous (MISC).\n",

    "<br>xlm-roberta-large-ner-hrl is a Named Entity Recognition model for 10 high resourced languages (Arabic, German, English, Spanish, French, Italian, Latvian, Dutch, Portuguese and Chinese) based on a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa large model.\n",
    "### Labels\n",
    "<br>This model was fine-tuned on English version of the standard CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition dataset.\n",
    "<br>The training dataset distinguishes between the beginning and continuation of an entity so that if there are back-to-back entities of the same type, the model can output where the second entity begins. As in the dataset, each token will be classified as one of the following classes:\n",

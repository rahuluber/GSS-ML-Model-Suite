# GSS-ML-Model-Suite
GSS MLOps ML Model Suite is a central repository of re-usable, pre-trained ml models. The code base can be easily used to experiment around different bussines use cases with minimal effort of developing & training the model. This repository can be used for different computer vision (image data) and nlp (text data) use cases which are listed below:
## Computer Vision Use Cases
#### Image Enhancement
Image enhancement module can be used for do the following moddification in a given image: 
1. Resize the image
2. Add the borders
3. 
#### Object Detection
Object Detection module is used to detect any object in a given image. An object detection model identifies the object (what the object is ? Is it a dog or a cat?) and also locates the object in the image. It will give a bounding box around the object of interest. <Add an example image>
## NLP Use Cases
#### Text Similarity
#### Text Classification
